"""Tier B — agent integration evals. Calls the model, so it gates PRs, not pushes.

The split that shapes this file is invariants versus signals:

  invariant   exactly one acceptable behaviour, checkable in code.
              `assert` it — a failure turns CI red like any unit test.
  signal      lives on a spectrum with no single correct string.
              `log_evaluation` only — never assert. Judge output is
              non-deterministic, and we have direct evidence: the leak metric
              moved 6.7 points on a single run and turned out to be sampling
              noise. A judge in a blocking gate flakes builds, and a flaky gate
              gets disabled.

Signals still gate — on the aggregate, nightly, not per case. That job belongs
to `evals/run_experiment.py`, not here.

Cases are a representative subset of the golden dataset rather than all 199: a
PR gate should be fast and cover every dimension cell, and the full suite runs
on a schedule. Stable `ids` keep each case the same Phoenix example across runs.
