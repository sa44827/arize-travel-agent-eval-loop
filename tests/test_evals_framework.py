"""Tests for the eval framework itself.

The framework gates the agent; nothing was gating the framework. Every bug found
in this layer so far was found by running it against production — a purge that
swallowed an HTTP 422 and reported success, a report that keyed by example and
silently discarded two thirds of a repetitions run, an empty-window KeyError
that failed every quiet hour, an agent-agnostic module with one agent's name
hardcoded in it. All four are checkable in milliseconds. None were caught before
they shipped.

Hermetic by construction: no Phoenix, no model, no network. Scores are small
synthetic DataFrames in exactly the shape `monitor.score` and
`monitor.read_annotations` produce.
