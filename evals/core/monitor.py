"""Online evaluation: score live production spans and write the results back
onto the trace as Phoenix annotations.

This is the half of the system that makes evals *observability* rather than
testing. The offline path (`runner.py`) scores a fixed golden dataset and
answers "did this change help?". This path scores whatever real users actually
sent and answers "is it healthy right now?" — which is what the customer asked
for with "live eval in production, alerts in prod".

The two paths share one registry, so an evaluator is written once. What decides
whether it can run here is `online`: an evaluator that needs a ground-truth
label cannot run against live traffic, because production has no labels. That
is the real dividing line between the tiers — not just "code can't score taste",
but "most of the deterministic suite has nothing to compare against out here."

    Annotations are keyed by (span, name), so re-running a sweep updates in

    gains an applicability rule, its old scores linger on turns it should never
    have graded. Purging before a re-sweep is what keeps the platform showing
    what the current code would actually produce.

    Scoped two ways: by evaluator name, so human annotations (`user_feedback`)
    and other agents' scores are untouched; and by time window, because Phoenix
    rejects an unbounded delete unless you pass `delete_all`. Taking the bounded
    path deliberately — an eval harness should not hold a loaded gun.

    Raises on any failure rather than returning it, because an earlier version
    collected errors into a dict the caller never inspected and reported a
    no-op purge as a success.
