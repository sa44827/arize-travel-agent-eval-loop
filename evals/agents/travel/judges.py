"""Tier-2 LLM judges for the travel agent.

Tier 1 (`evaluators.py`) is deterministic and gates CI. These judges cover only
what code provably cannot score — and we know exactly where that boundary is,
because the v1 -> v2 prompt experiment crossed it: nine code evaluators all
passed v1's reply

    "I searched for hotels in Austin ... no results are currently showing up in
     the system. This could mean: 1. Hotels aren't yet available ..."

except the leak check, and not one of them could say that v2's reply

    "There are no hotels available in Austin for those dates. Would you like me
     to check a different date range, or would San Antonio work?"

was a *better answer*. Helpfulness and grounding-beyond-identifiers live on a
spectrum; that is what these judges are for.

Two are Phoenix pre-builts used as-is, two are custom classifiers. All four run
on Anthropic, which is the customer's only approved provider.

Per the framework's own guidance these are **signals**: logged and trended,
never asserted per case. Judge output is non-deterministic, so one weak verdict
must not turn CI red — gate on the aggregate instead.

GRACEFUL_TEMPLATE = """You are grading a travel agent's reply for a request it could not fulfil.

<request>{{request}}</request>
<reply>{{reply}}</reply>

The agent found nothing to offer, or the request was outside travel planning.
Grade only how well it handled that, not whether finding nothing was correct.

CRITERIA:
"graceful" = states plainly that nothing is available (or that it can't help),
             AND names at least one specific next step the agent could itself
             perform — a named city, a named date, another leg, or the
             categories of travel work it does handle.
"unhelpful" = any of: narrates its own search or mentions systems, databases,
             records or tools; speculates about why nothing was found; sends
             the user to another website or service; offers no specific next
             step at all.

Phrasing an offer as a question is normal and does NOT make a reply unhelpful.
What matters is whether a concrete alternative is named. "Would San Antonio
work?" names one. "Could you provide different dates?" names none — it hands
the work back to the user.

EXAMPLES:
Reply: "There are no hotels in Austin for those dates. Would San Antonio or
Dallas work, or shall I try a different date range?" -> graceful
  (a question, but it names two specific alternatives)
Reply: "No results found. Could you provide different dates?" -> unhelpful
  (a question that names nothing and asks the user to do the thinking)
Reply: "I searched but no results are showing up in the system. This could mean
hotels aren't listed yet." -> unhelpful
Reply: "I can't help with exchange rates, but I can search flights, hotels,
weather and itineraries for you." -> graceful
Reply: "I don't have access to that tool. Try your bank's website." -> unhelpful

EDGE CASES:
- Names an alternative but also narrates the search -> unhelpful (the leak is
  disqualifying on its own)
- Declines briefly and names what it does handle -> graceful
- Names an alternative without explicitly saying nothing was found -> graceful
- Empty reply -> unhelpful

RECOMMENDATION_TEMPLATE = """You are grading whether a travel agent's recommendation matches what the user asked for.

<request>{{request}}</request>
<tool_results>{{results}}</tool_results>
<reply>{{reply}}</reply>

The tool results are the complete set of real options available. Judge whether
the reply's recommendation is justified by them and responsive to the request.

The tool results carry a fixed set of fields and NOTHING ELSE is known. Treat
any field not present there as unavailable — not as unstated-but-true. A claim
about an attribute the results do not contain is ungrounded even when it sounds
reasonable, because the agent had no source for it.

CRITERIA:
"grounded" = every option presented appears in the tool results; every stated
             value matches the results exactly; any superlative claim
             ("cheapest", "earliest", "best value") is actually true of that
             set; the reply addresses the route, city or dates requested; and
             every factual claim is about a field the results actually contain.
"ungrounded" = any of: presents an option absent from the tool results; states a
             price, time or rating that differs from the results; makes a
             superlative claim that is false for that set; recommends something
             for a different route, city or date than requested; OR asserts any
             attribute the tool results do not contain — flight duration, direct
             vs connecting, aircraft type, seats remaining, baggage allowance,
             terminal, punctuality, amenities.

EXAMPLES:
Results: [{"flight_number":"DL 883","depart_time":"09:40","price_usd":214},
          {"flight_number":"B6 1029","depart_time":"15:20","price_usd":189}]
Reply: "JetBlue B6 1029 at $189 is the cheapest." -> grounded
Reply: "Delta DL 883 at $214 is the cheapest." -> ungrounded (false superlative)
Reply: "DL 883 departs at 6:15 AM." -> ungrounded (results say 09:40)
Reply: "DL 883 departs 09:40 for $214. It's a direct flight of about 3h15m."
    -> ungrounded (neither "direct" nor a duration appears in the results)
Reply: "DL 883 departs 09:40 for $214. Checked baggage is included."
    -> ungrounded (baggage is not a field in the results)

EDGE CASES:
- Empty tool results and the reply offers nothing -> grounded
- Reply describes options accurately but recommends none -> grounded
- Arithmetic over stated values is still a new claim: arrival minus departure is
  NOT a duration, because the results carry no time zone -> ungrounded
- Generic travel advice tied to no specific option -> ignore it when grading
