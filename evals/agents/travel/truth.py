"""Ground truth for the travel agent, derived from the fixtures.

The whole eval strategy rests on this module. Because every tool is backed by a
local JSON fixture, the correct answer to any query is *computable* rather than
a matter of judgment. That is what lets us build a labelled golden dataset with
no SME and no LLM in the labelling path — which in turn is what keeps the LLM
judges honest, since nothing an LLM generated is ever used as a label.

Everything here reads the same fixtures the agent's tools read, but reimplements
the lookup independently. Calling `agent.tools.search_flights` to produce the
expected answer would make the eval tautological: a bug in the tool would show
up identically on both sides and score as a pass.
